# Event-Driven Microservices Orchestration using Camunda, Spring Boot, and ActiveMQ

This is an example project based on the article: ["Event-driven Orchestration: An Effective Microservices Integration using BPMN and AMQP"](https://dzone.com/articles/event-driven-orchestration-an-effective-microservi).

## Overview
This sample consists of three sub-projects:
* __canonical-model__

	The canonical data model.
	
* __shoppingcart-service__

    A sample orchestration service demonstrating an end-to-end shopping cart fulfillment flow.
    
* __service-stubs__

    A project simulating the integrated services that communicate with the shopping cart service in either a synchronous (i.e. an RPC client) or an asynchronous (i.e. a message subscriber)  way.

## How to Use
### Prerequisite

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/)
* [Camunda BPM](https://camunda.com/)
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

### Build
* Clone or download project from [github](https://github.com/mocvin/microservices-orchestration-using-camunda-activemq)
* Build the three projects respectively. For example:
```
$ cd microservices-orchestration-using-camunda-activemq
$ cd canonical-model
$ mvn clean install
$ cd ../shoppingcart-service
$ mvn clean install
$ cd ../service-stubs
$ mvn clean install
```
### Launch Services

#### Launch the Stub Services
The following services will be launched as the integrated participants in the shopping cart fulfillment flow:
* Location Service: validate customer's shipping address
* Payment Service: process payment for the shopping cart
* Inventory Service: allocate product from inventory
* Order Service: fulfill the customer order
* Customer Service: notify the customer about the shopping fulfillment state
* Back Office Service: handle the exception if  transaction rollback is not possible

Launch the service simulator respectively as below:
```
$ cd microservices-orchestration-amqp-example
$ cd service-stubs/target
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,location,default
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,payment,default
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,inventory,default
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,order,default
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,customer,default
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-stub-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-consumer,backoffice,default
```
#### Launch the Main Orchestration Service -  the Shopping Cart Service
```
$ cd microservices-orchestration-amqp-example
$ cd shoppingcart-service/target
$ java -jar microservice-orchestration-using-camunda-amqp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=amqp-producer
```
### Test Shopping Cart Fulfillment Flow
#### Scenario 1: Submit Shopping Cart Successfully - Transaction Committed

* Request to Submit a Shopping Cart:
```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/shoppingCart/1c93e02a-e7c6-418b-ae01-c047cefe0001/submit

```
	
* Expected Response:

  * Submit Shopping Cart is successful; the shopping cart is CLOSED
  * HTTP status code: 200

    }
  ]
}
```
* Executed Services
As shown in the service log, the fulfillment flow has executed all steps end-to-end:
```
2018-06-27 14:05:12.099  INFO 14672 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.m.o.d.b.RetrieveShoppingCartActivity   : execute ShoppingCartService - retrieve

```

#### Scenario 2: Submit Shopping Cart Failed Due to Order Service Issue  - Transaction Rolled Back


* Request to Submit a Shopping Cart:
```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/shoppingCart/invalid-OrderService/submit

```
	
* Expected Response:

  * Submit Shopping Cart is failed due to the processing error in placing the order to the Order Service
  * HTTP status code: 403

```json

{
    "code": "ERR_ORDER_FAILURE",
    "message": "Unable to process order.",
    "details": "Internal Error: Unable to process order, please contact the system administrator."
}
```
* Executed Services
As shown in the service log, the compensation flow was executed to release the reserved payment and the allocated inventory. The transaction has been rolled back successfully.
```
2018-06-27 14:12:02.760  INFO 14672 --- [nio-8080-exec-4] c.m.o.d.b.RetrieveShoppingCartActivity   : execute ShoppingCartService - retrieve

```

#### Scenario 3: Submit Shopping Cart Failed when Location Service is down  - Transaction Aborted
* Prerequisite
  Shutdown the location service by killing the process.
  
* Request to Submit a Shopping Cart:
```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/shoppingCart/1c93e02a-e7c6-418b-ae01-c047cefe0002/submit

```
	
* Expected Response:

  * Submit Shopping Cart is failed due to the unavailability of the Location Service
  * HTTP status code: 403

```json

{
    "code": "ERR_SERVICE_UNAVAIL",
    "message": "Service Unavaialble",
    "details": "Internal Error: we are sorry, the LocationService is not reachable. Please try again later."
}
```
* Executed Services
As shown in the service log, the flow was stopped due to the timeout in invoking the location service. Rollback is not required in this case.
```
2018-06-27 14:18:49.266  INFO 14672 --- [nio-8080-exec-7] c.m.o.d.b.RetrieveShoppingCartActivity   : execute ShoppingCartService - retrieve
2018-06-27 14:18:49.282  INFO 14672 --- [nio-8080-exec-7] c.m.o.demo.bpm.ValidateAddressActivity   : execute LocationService - validate
```
## What's Next
In order to keep the sample project simple, the advanced topics of event handling are not addressed, such as RPC timeout, message TTL, clustered services, etc. 
But I hope this sample would help as a start point.
